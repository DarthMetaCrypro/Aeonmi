Reporting a Vulnerability
Security is a top priority for the Aeonmi project. If you discover a security issue, do not open a public GitHub issue. Public disclosure of vulnerabilities before a fix is released can put users at risk.

Instead, please follow these steps:

Investigation Timeline:

Initial assessment within 5 business days.

Status updates will be provided at least every 7 days until the issue is resolved.

Resolution & Disclosure:

Critical issues will be patched as soon as possible.

Once a fix is released, a public advisory will be issued along with credit (unless anonymity is requested).

We follow coordinated disclosure best practices.
