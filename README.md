Aeonmi v0.2.0 – Closed Source Pre-Release
⚠️ Notice:
Aeonmi is currently a closed-source project. No redistribution, modification, reverse engineering, or unauthorized use of any kind is permitted without explicit written consent from the author. All rights reserved. This pre-release is provided for demonstration, evaluation, and controlled collaboration purposes only.

Overview
Aeonmi is an advanced programming language and compiler framework designed for AI-native, secure, and multi-dimensional computing. It introduces QUBE, a symbolic and hieroglyphic inner-core language capable of adaptive, self-modifying operations, quantum-resistant encryption, and deep AI integration.

Version 0.2.0 delivers the initial operational codebase, test scaffolding, and compiler infrastructure required to begin controlled internal evaluation.

Highlights in v0.2.0
Core Compiler Pipeline – Fully implemented lexer, parser, semantic analyzer, and code generator modules.

QUBE Integration Layer – Foundation for symbolic and quantum glyph parsing.

Robust Test Suite – Modular test files for compiler components:

compiler_pipeline.rs

control_flow.rs

functions.rs

quantum_glyph.rs

Diagnostics System – Advanced error handling with rich contextual output.

Security by Design – Quantum-resistant cryptographic stubs embedded in the architecture.

Strict Licensing – All code remains proprietary; public use is restricted.
