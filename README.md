# Aeonmi
The Aeonmi repository is a next-generation programming platform combining Web2 and Web3 technologies. A quantum-inspired computation layer (QUBE), advanced AI integration (Mother AI), and Titan libraries for scalability and automation. Aeonmi supports secure blockchain modules, dynamic syntax, and extensible libraries to future-proof development.

## Key Features
- **Hybrid Ecosystem**: Seamlessly integrates Web2 and Web3 technologies for versatile application development.
- **QUBE (Quantum Universal Base Engine)**: Implements quantum-inspired features like superposition and probabilistic computation to enhance reasoning and symbolic learning.
- **Mother AI**: An AI system designed with ethical reasoning and advanced NLP capabilities, enabling intelligent automation and decision-making.
- **Titan Libraries**: A robust set of libraries focusing on mathematical functions, string manipulation, performance optimization, and security.
- **Custom CLI**: Aeonmi’s Command Line Interface offers efficient control over its features, simplifying tasks like compilation, script execution, and debugging.
- **Blockchain Modules**: Features decentralized ledger support for immutable version control and secure data handling.
- **Developer-Friendly Syntax**: Inspired by Rust and Python, Aeonmi offers modularity, strong typing, and intuitive syntax for streamlined development.

## Custom CLI
The Aeonmi CLI provides a streamlined way to interact with the ecosystem. Key commands include:
- `aeonmi run <script.ai>`: Executes an Aeonmi script.
- `aeonmi build`: Compiles Aeonmi code into an executable format.
- `aeonmi test`: Runs unit and integration tests.
- `aeonmi help`: Displays help for all CLI commands.

## Getting Started
1. **Install Rust**: Ensure rustup is installed. Follow the [Rust Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
2. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DarthMetaCrypro/Aeonmi.git
    cd Aeonmi
    ```
3. **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```
4. **Run the CLI**:
    ```bash
